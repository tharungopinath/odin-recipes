    <p>
        This green onion garlic naan has become one of my go-to comfort recipes-it’s soft, buttery, and packed with flavor from the garlic and fresh green onions. 
        I started making it when I wanted something a little more exciting than plain naan to go with curries or soups, and now I honestly crave it on its own. 
        It’s pan-cooked, so no fancy oven or tandoor needed, and the smell alone while it's cooking is worth the effort. 
        Whether you serve it with a meal or just tear into it as a snack, this naan always disappears fast in my kitchen.
